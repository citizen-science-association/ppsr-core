PPSR Core is maintained by an international group of volunteers including members of the Citizen Science Association and it's sister organizations. The project itself is administrated by the Citizen Science Association's [Data & Metadata Working Group](https://www.citizenscience.org/get-involved/working-groups/data-and-metadata-working-group/).
